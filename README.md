# Cloudinary - Basic PHP SDK v2 Samples

#Overview

Cloudinary PHP V2 SDK is the first SDK2.0 release.

Designed to change the way developers interact with our service, it brings a more language oriented approach and
improved developer experience. 

There's increased discoverability to help developers figure out what can be done and to keep mistakes to a minimum.

This sample project is part of the PHP V2 alpha. 

You can install the new SDK, play around with the syntax and see the results in live view.
